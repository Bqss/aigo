So, itâ€™s a cake made from sesame and sugar.\n\nThis snack almost resembles Geti Cake from Central Java. But the difference is in the grains used as basic ingredients. Geti cake uses sesame seeds, while Jaja Geti-geti uses godem. Godem is a black mustard seed which is usually used as a feed for a turtle bird. Relax, godem can also be consumed by humans! Because these grains have many health benefits for our body. ",
